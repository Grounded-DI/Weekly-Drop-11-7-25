## 📌 What It Does

The **DI Age Verifier** is a deterministic **post-classification filter**. It accepts structured **age estimation output** from third-party AI tools and applies strict logic to verify if the subject should be flagged as a **Minor**, **Adult**, or **Indeterminate**.

> ✅ **No image processing**  
> ✅ **No probabilistic guesswork**  
> ✅ **No adaptive feedback**

This system functions as a **final-layer gatekeeper**, applying immutable scroll-based logic for audit-safe use.

## 🧬 Inputs

Expected input: **JSON-style output** from a separate AI age estimator.

```json
{
  "age_estimate": 16.9,
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "source_model": "ExternalModelX",
  "image_id": "img001234",
  "notes": "bright lighting; partial profile"
}


⸻

📜 Core Ruleset (Scroll-Sealed)
	•	If age_estimate < 18 and confidence ≥ 0.75 → Minor
	•	If age_estimate ≥ 18 and confidence ≥ 0.75 → Adult
	•	If confidence < 0.75 → Indeterminate
	•	Flag logic:
	•	confidence < 0.75 → Low Confidence
	•	17.8 ≤ age_estimate ≤ 18.2 → Borderline Age
	•	Missing keys → Malformed Input

These rules are locked under Scroll 155 and ∆H = 0.0042 governance. They do not adapt or update over time.

🧾 Output Format

{
  "verdict": "Minor",
  "reason": "Estimated age = 16.9 with 0.87 confidence",
  "flag": null,
  "tier": "Verified"
}

Audit-ready, human-readable, and formatted for downstream compliance or policy layers.

🚫 What It Doesn’t Do
	•	❌ No facial recognition
	•	❌ No image or video input
	•	❌ No personal data storage
	•	❌ No probabilistic model or learning loop
	•	❌ No external API or tracking

⸻

⚖️ Intended Use Cases

This app is appropriate for:
	•	Parental Control Filters
	•	Youth Platform Gatekeeping (13+ / 18+)
	•	Risk Audits involving Minors
	•	Internal age labeling workflows (e.g. moderation)
	•	Regulatory Support / Compliance Snapshot Tools

It is not designed for legal ID enforcement, criminal procedures, or real-time biometric scanning.

🧠 Governance & Entropy Enforcement

This app is governed by the deterministic scroll layer used in all Grounded DI systems:
	•	🔐 Scroll Protocol: Activated
	•	🧬 Entropy Lock: ∆H = 0.0042 (witness threshold)
	•	🛰️ Tier: Reflex-10 Lock (Immutable)
	•	🧭 TrapLayer: Active
	•	👁️ Nightwatch: Passive Monitoring Enabled

🧩 Optional Future Features
	•	🔄 CSV batch ingestion (offline mod queues)
	•	🧾 ZIP-wrapped audit logs for compliance
	•	🧠 UI wrapper (internal-only or NGO use)
	•	⚙️ Modular plug-in for external moderation engines
